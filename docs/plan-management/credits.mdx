Lotus' credit system allows your customers to have alternative ways of accessing your product beyond the standard invoicing cycle. Some common use cases include:

- Making the first $x dollars of usage free, like AWS does when they offer $100,000 in credits to cover usage when you first start.
- Reimbursing customers for downtime or missing SLAs.
- Prepaying usage at a discount, in order to draw down from a pool of credits.
